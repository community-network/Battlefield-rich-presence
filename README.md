Download the tool via the release tab on GitHub: https://github.com/community-network/Battlefield-rich-presence/releases/

The standard version of the program installs like any other program and runs on startup, so no need to start it everytime you start battlefield! (and can ofcourse be removed like other programs)

It will run in the background with an icon in the taskbar.

For Battlefield 3, 4, hardline, 5 and bad company 2, you need to configure your in game name. Right click on the taskbar icon and select "Edit settings". Then enter your in game name in the form and click "Save".

The option to send the current playerlist to gametools is disabled by default, which we can use to display the kills/deaths of the current round in the detailed serverinfo page for Battlefield 1 servers.
